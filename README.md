## Concept
This project explores the sociological phenomena of over-apologizing. Over-apologizing refers to saying, “I’m sorry” when you don’t need to. Apologizing too quickly can also come with social consequences—for example, many people argue that women are disadvantaged in the workplace by apologizing more frequently than men. The comedian Amy Schumer’s [“I’m sorry” skit](https://vimeo.com/253499468) captures the phenomenon well, depicting successful women over-apologizing at an “innovator’s conference” to the point of absurdity. “Why are women always apologizing?” the [Pantene commercial asks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcGKxLJ4ZGI). So if you are like me and apologize for everything, mostly when you know you shouldn’t, how do we fix it?

## Idea
The idea is based on a Twitter thread by [@NihachuEatsCats](https://twitter.com/NihachuEatsCats/status/1306447628335370241), where users started the sentence with “I am sorry for being” and let their keyboard finish the sentence. It usually resulted in pretty nonsense apologies like “I’m sorry for being a baguette.” Still, some of them seemed pretty normal, “I’m sorry for being a good friend,” yet unnecessary.

## AI + graphic design
I want to hyperbolize the act of over-apologizing by creating a generative NLP model trained on examples of more than 10000 tweets. Ten thousand people’s automatic keyboards recommendation produced these tweets, so the final AI model is AI of the AIs, a sum of distributed intelligence that will generate brand new apologies based on the dataset that will be created.

The result will be presented as an interactive website where you can generate  apologies - your daily dose of unnecessary apologies, have as many as you want so you can stop doing that in real life. A user can share her unnecessary apology to social networks or save it as a picture
The background color, text, and typography are generated according to the implemented aesthetic rules. Each generated apology is thus not only an exploration of the possibilities of artificial intelligence but also of semi-random color and typographic combinations.
